This is a practice project for the HTML basics. It contains only HTML tags, links and images that are the foundation of the web page design.

Unfortunately at this stage the page will look blunt, with no nice paragraph, css or js to work between pages

** Edit**

The index now contains a css file with styles to start learning about styles and how these can be used with html.

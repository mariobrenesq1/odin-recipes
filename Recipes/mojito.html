  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>The mojito is a sour cocktail that originated in Havana, Cuba and has become one of the world’s most popular rum drinks. Some say it stems back to the 1580’s with a drink called the Draque, named after Sir Francis Drake. Others say it solidified in the mid-1800’s when the Bacardi rum company created a spin on the Draque using rum. Some think Americans brought the Mint Julep to Cuba, which spawned a variation with rum. </p>
